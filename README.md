Hello!

here I'm sharing the document on how to create Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline - SonarQube, Docker, Github Webhooks on AWS

- Jenkins is an open-source automation server that streamlines software development tasks. It automates building, testing, and deploying software. Github serves as a code repository with version control and collaboration tools. Sonarqube manages code quality by analyzing and improving software projects. Docker simplifies application deployment through containerization.
- To create a CI/CD pipeline, we start by setting up an AWS EC2 instance and installing Jenkins. Then, we integrate a Github repository with Jenkins. Next, we configure Sonarqube to analyze code quality in the Github repository. Finally, we create a Docker image of the application and deploy it using Jenkins.
- Throughout the process, we emphasize the significance of each step and provide detailed instructions on configuring the tools for seamless integration. This CI/CD pipeline automates software development, ensuring code quality.
- This project demonstrates setting up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Github, Sonarqube, and Docker on an AWS EC2 instance. The workflow involves pushing code to Github, pulling it to Jenkins, testing it on Sonarqube for bug detection and static code analysis, and deploying it to Docker if the tests pass
